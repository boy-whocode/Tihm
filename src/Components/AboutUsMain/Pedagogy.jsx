          <h3>Orientation And Pedagogy</h3>
          <p>
            The study of fact, theory and concept is not sufficient to educate a hospitality professional.
            The individual must have the opportunity to see the skills, processes and ingredients in action, and to practice 
            them. Hospitality involves high level of motor and interpersonal skills learning. The profession 
            requires a great combination of the art and science and these skills can only be learned in practice.
            <br />
            Pedagogy at TIHM, Jodhpur is largely based on this principle and is a mix of many learning methodologies.
            Apart from the usual chalk-n-talk, there is a conscious effort to make the sessions interactive by using case 
            studies and references of latest developments in the hospitality field. The pedagogy at TIHM is 
            designed to incorporate the appropriate practical components to have a thorough grounding in the art and science 
            of practical learning.
